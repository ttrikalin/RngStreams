# RngStreams

**RngStreams** is an object-oriented random-number package with many long streams and substreams,
based on the MRG32k3a RNG from reference [1] below and proposed in [2].

This repository is a C++ implementation, but **RngStreams** is also available for C, Java, R, OpenCL, and some other languages.

## License

The package is under an Apache 2.0 license, copyrighted by Pierre L'Ã‰cuyer and the University of Montreal. It can be used freely for any purpose.

## Build

Clone the project
``` sh
git clone git@github.com:umontreal-simul/RngStreams.git
```


For single configuration generator, such as Unix Makefiles, the default configuration is Release.
You can specify Debug configuration giving this command-line option to CMake: ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug``.

``` sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. [-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug] [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_path>]
make
```

## Installation

To install **RngStreams** in the install path specified with the option ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``, execute the **install** target, e.g. on Linux:

``` sh
make install
```

## Compile against **RngStreams**

Add these lines to you CMakeLists.txt:

``` cmake
find_package(RngStreams REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(<your_target>
    PRIVATE RngStreams::RngStreams)
```

If the **RngStreams** installation path is not standard, set RngStreams_ROOT to the installation
path when invoking cmake:

``` bash
cmake -DRngStreams_ROOT=/rngstreams/install/path ...
```

## Tests

You need GoogleTest installed in your system. Get it from https://github.com/google/googletest. 

Finally, run the test
``` sh
cd build 
make test
```
